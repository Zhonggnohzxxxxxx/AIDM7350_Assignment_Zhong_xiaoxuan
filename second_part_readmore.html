                        <p>In ancient times, mountains, rivers, deserts, and oceans often confined humans to relatively isolated geographical environments, but they never hindered the deep-seated desire within humans: communication.</p>
                        <p>There was once a road that traversed mountains and deserts, broke through geographical barriers, and connected ancient China, neighboring countries, and the West. The sound of camel bells echoed as caravans laden with silk, porcelain, wool, and jade traveled back and forth along this route; monks and envoys, chasing their dreams, journeyed tirelessly on this path. This road became a major artery for commercial and cultural exchange between the East and the West.</p>
                        <p>This route, most famously represented by the silk exported from China, was known as the Silk Road. Although the Silk Road is named after silk, what was exchanged along this route was not limited to silk and silk-weaving techniques; it was the primary channel for cultural exchange between the East and the West. Along this road, what was exchanged included, firstly, materials and goods, and secondly, technology and culture. These goods and technologies formed the main content of mutual learning and exchange on the Silk Road.</p>
                        <p>This exhibition aims to showcase, through individual artifacts, the stories of mutual learning and exchange along the Silk Road. The exhibits here have been meticulously selected from nearly 20 cultural and museum institutions across the country. Each group of artifacts will be accompanied by an expert who will narrate their stories. </p>

The bottom of the plate is hammered out to wrap around peach shaped leaf patterns, with four mythological figures inside. Two centaurs pull a chariot, one of whom has his right hand on his hips and his left hand holding a drinking cup. The latter centaur is basically blocked, but their movements should be basically the same. There are two people standing on the chariot, the former holding a scepter in his right hand and holding an object in his left hand, while the latter holding an object in his left hand and holding a baton in his right hand. All characters have deep eyes and high noses, curly and thick beard and hair, bulging muscles, strong and brave, with a distinct Greek and Roman sculptural style.</p>

Caliber 9.2, height 5.8 centimeters. The color and shape of this cup are different from the commonly seen dark blue cups in the local area. According to expert testing and analysis, the chemical composition of its glass is high alumina low calcium potassium glass, which is different from the sword shaped and bead shaped lead barium glass made in China. Potassium glass is an ancient glass system unique to India, Southeast Asia, as well as southern and southwestern China. It has been discovered in many sites in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia. Therefore, it is preliminarily judged that the glass cup unearthed from Huangnigang Tomb No. 1 belongs to a subcategory of potassium glass in the South China Sea trade circle, which was transported by sea from Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p class="w3-large">The young man played by Panxin, who holds a staff and leans on a beast, is mostly judged by Chinese and foreign scholars to be the god of wine in ancient Greek mythology: Dionysus. The text engraved on the silver plate is believed by more researchers to be written in the Daxia script, which was already used in the Greek alphabet cursive script during the Guishuang period of the Daxia. Regarding the era of silver plates, the Gansu Provincial Museum has designated it as the Eastern Roman period, which is approximately equivalent to the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties period in China. Perhaps this silver plate was a tribute left by the Eastern Roman envoy at the ancient crossing of the Yellow River, or it could have been an exchange item carried by Western merchants during that era.</p>

                        <p class="w3-large">This blue and white sailboat design features a combination of Chinese and Western elements on the flower mouth plate. The mouth edge and inner wall belong to typical traditional Chinese patterns. But the sailboat diagram drawn by Panxin is roughly similar to European sailboats in the 17th and 18th centuries. From the overall effect, there is still a certain gap between the depiction and the real ship. Therefore, it can be inferred that during the Qianlong period, Jingdezhen craftsmen received orders from Europe to fire European ships in blue and white porcelain plates. The craftsman had never seen it before, so he created art based on the Chinese ocean going sailboat at that time, adding Western elements. So, the image of Western sailboats appeared on the porcelain of Jingdezhen.</p>

                        <p class="w3-large">In this work, the themes of Tikka and Hercules, human lion combat patterns, and colorful flower ribbons originally belonged to Greek mythology, while the art of warding off evil came from Chinese art. Cotton textiles, indigo dyeing, and wax printing techniques should have originated from India, and a large number of geometric decorative patterns are very common in Gandhara art. The nude and sexy artistic style belongs to the characteristics of the Mathura region of the Kushan Empire. Therefore, this fabric gathers numerous cultural elements and technologies from both the East and the West, making it an extremely rare artistic treasure in the cultural exchange between the East and the West.</p>

The first Hellenistic style Buddha statue was born in Gandhara. The art of Later Gandhara was introduced to China through the Silk Road paved by Zhang Qian, and it is the origin of Chinese Buddhist art.</p>

                        <p class="w3-large">This piece was unearthed from the silver gilded lotus flower treasure incense burner in the underground palace. The overall shape is a horizontally arranged lotus flower, with flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems all present. Using lotus leaves as a support. A lotus flower stands tall and graceful as a furnace. A stem is lifted from the furnace, with a Buddha statue on top and a backlight behind. It sits on a lotus pedestal in a staggered manner. There are two buds waiting to bloom and one bud. Several branches form a bundle, becoming the long stem of the incense burner. At the end of the handle, there is also a precious stone attached. Baozi has finely crafted lids, which are combined with the body to create a lifelike lotus pod. This type of incense burner should be exclusively used for incense and Buddha worship. The spice trade on the Maritime Silk Road flourished during the Song Dynasty, and the overland Silk Road was not cut off. Foreign spices enter China through tribute or trade, and are transported by sea and land, greatly enriching the connotation of Chinese fragrance culture.</p>

                        <p class="w3-large">The religious themed stone carving on the tombstone is located at the pointed arch, depicting the Virgin and Child on the throne. The middle section of the tombstone depicts the martyrdom of Christian saint Catherine, who shares the same name as the deceased. The emperor's threats and temptations were unable to make Catherine give up her Christian faith, and ultimately decided to impose the "Broken Wheel" punishment on Catherine. Before the execution, she knelt down with her hands clasped together and prayed, with the wheel used for torture beside her. Perhaps due to the miracle performed by the two angels above, the wheel broke and fell to one side, and the two executioners also lay on the ground; Unable to torture her to death, the emperor had to order her to be beheaded, and an executioner was pulling out a long sword and cutting at Saint Catherine. After Catherine's martyrdom, angels flew in to take her body to Mount Sinai in Egypt.</p>

                        <p>Since the German geographer Richthofen proposed the Silk Road in the late 19th century, after nearly a century of research, people have gradually realized that the Silk Road is not just a simple route, it is a network, whether it is the Oasis Road, Grassland Road, Ocean Road, or Southwest Plateau Road.</p>
                        <p>The Silk Road is not only a difficult road, but also a road of communication and friendship. It has broken through geographical barriers, driven the exchanges of civilizations between the continents, promoted the integration of nations, and enhanced the understanding and feelings of the people of countries along the route.</p>
